#### **--add-host**=*hostname[;hostname[;...]]*:*ip*

Add a custom host-to-IP mapping to the <<container|pod>>'s `/etc/hosts` file.

The option takes one or multiple semicolon-separated hostnames to be mapped to
a single IPv4 or IPv6 address, separated by a colon. It can also be used to
overwrite the IP addresses of hostnames Podman adds to `/etc/hosts` by default
(also see the **--name** and **--hostname** options). This option can be
specified multiple times to add additional mappings to `/etc/hosts`. It
conflicts with the **--no-hosts** option.

Instead of an IP address, the special flag *host-gateway* can be given. This
resolves to an IP address the container can use to connect to the host. The
IP address chosen depends on your network setup, thus there's no guarantee that
Podman can determine the *host-gateway* address automatically, which will then
cause Podman to fail with an error message. You can overwrite this IP address
using the *host_containers_internal_ip* option in *containers.conf*.

The *host-gateway* address is also used by Podman to automatically add the
`host.containers.internal` and `host.docker.internal` hostnames to `/etc/hosts`.
You can prevent that by either giving the **--no-hosts** option, or by setting
*host_containers_internal_ip="none"* in *containers.conf*. If no *host-gateway*
address was configured manually and Podman fails to determine the IP address
automatically, Podman will silently skip adding these internal hostnames to
`/etc/hosts`.
